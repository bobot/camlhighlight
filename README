1. Overview
===========

Camlhighlight provides syntax highlighting and pretty-printing facilities
for displaying code samples in Ocsigen applications. The library works
by interfacing with the core portion of Highlight [1], a widely available
application supporting the most common programming and markup languages.


2. Dependencies
===============

On the Ocaml side, Camlhighlight depends on ExtLib, Ocaml-Pcre, and Ocsigen
[2,3,4].  The Ocsigen libraries are required because Camlhighlight provides
functions that output values from Ocsigen's XHTML.M module.

Camlhighlight requires also Highlight.  Use version 2.10 or higher, since
earlier releases do not make a clean separation between the core library
and the command line application.


3. Building and installing
==========================

Edit Camlhighlight's top-level Makefile to configure the location of
Highlight's libhighlight.a, C++ header files, and the style and language
definition files (*.style and *.lang).

Typing "make" suffices to build the Camlhighlight library.  After
building, "make install" will perform a findlib installation.  To
generate the ocamldoc API documentation, use "make apidoc".
