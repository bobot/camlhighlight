=========================================================================

1. Overview
===========

Camlhighlight provides syntax highlighting and pretty-printing facilities
for displaying code samples in Ocsigen applications. The library works by
interfacing with the library portion of GNU Source-highlight [1], a popular
application supporting the most common programming and markup languages.


2. Dependencies
===============

On the Ocaml side, Camlhighlight depends on ExtLib, Sexplib, and TyXML
[2,3,4].  TyXML (which is part of the Ocsigen project [5]) is required because
Camlhighlight provides functions that output valid XHTML values using TyXML's
XHTML.M module, whereas Sexplib is used to provide serialisation facilities.

Camlhighlight requires also GNU Source-highlight, of course.  The library has
been tested with version 3.1, though subsequent versions should also work.
Note that for most Linux distros you may need to manually download and build
the source-code for GNU Source-highlight.  There are however some distros
that already package the library's runtime and development versions:

  * Ubuntu "Lucid Lynx" and more recent versions:

    Install packages 'source-highlight', 'libsource-highlight3' and 'libsource-highlight-dev'.


3. Building and installing
==========================

Change into the 'src' directory and edit the Makefile to configure the
location of GNU Source-highlight's C++ header files and libraries.

Typing 'make' suffices to build the Camlhighlight library.  After building,
'make install' will perform a findlib installation.  To generate the ocamldoc
API documentation, use 'make apidoc'.

Modules for OCamlduce will built automatically if you have OCamlduce
installed. But if you want to build a package without OCamlduce support,
run 'make DUCE=no && make DUCE=no install'.

You will also need to manually copy the file 'src/camlhighlight.outlang' into
GNU Source-highlight's data directory (normally '/usr/share/source-highlight').
