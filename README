1. Overview
===========

Camlhighlight provides syntax highlighting and pretty-printing facilities
for displaying code samples in Ocsigen applications. The library works
by parsing the output of Highlight [1], a widely available application
supporting the most common programming and markup languages.


2. Dependencies
===============

On the Ocaml side, Camlhighlight depends on ExtLib, Ocsigen, and PXP
[2,3,4].  ExtLib lends a number of utility functions, while PXP is used
to parse the output of the Highlight executable.  The Ocsigen libraries
are required because Camlhighlight provides functions that output values
from Ocsigen's XHTML.M module.

Camlhighlight invokes the Highlight executable, which must of course
be installed in the system.  Camlhighlight has been tested with version
2.6.14 of Highlight.


3. Building and installing
==========================

Typing "make" suffices to build the Camlhighlight library.  After
building, "make install" will perform a findlib installation.  To
generate the ocamldoc API documentation, use "make doc".
