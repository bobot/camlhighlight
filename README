1. Overview
===========

Camlhighlight provides syntax highlighting and pretty-printing facilities
for displaying code samples in Ocsigen applications. The library works by
interfacing with the library portion of GNU Source-highlight [1], a popular
application supporting the most common programming and markup languages.


2. Dependencies
===============

On the OCaml side, Camlhighlight depends on Batteries, Sexplib, and TyXML [2,3,4].
TyXML (which is part of the Ocsigen project [5]) is required because Camlhighlight
provides functions that output valid Html5 values using TyXML's Html5 module,
whereas Sexplib is used to provide serialisation facilities.

Camlhighlight requires also GNU Source-highlight, of course.  Note that for many
Linux distributions you may need to manually download and build the source-code
for GNU Source-highlight.  There are however some distros that already package the
library's runtime and development versions.  Debian and Ubuntu users, for instance,
should install packages 'libsource-highlight-common', 'libsource-highlight4' and
'libsource-highlight-dev'.


3. Building and installing
==========================

The build system relies on OASIS.  The customary sequence of './configure',
'make', and 'make install' is used to build and install the library.  Run
'make doc' to generate the API documentation.

You will also need to manually copy the file 'src/camlhighlight.outlang' into
GNU Source-highlight's data directory (normally '/usr/share/source-highlight').
