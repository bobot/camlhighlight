1. Overview
===========

Camlhighlight provides syntax highlighting and pretty-printing facilities
for displaying code samples in Ocsigen applications. The library works by
interfacing with the core portion of Highlight [1], a popular application
supporting the most common programming and markup languages.


2. Dependencies
===============

On the Ocaml side, Camlhighlight depends on ExtLib, Sexplib, Ulex, Ocsigen,
and Pcre-Ocaml [2,3,4,5,6].  The Ocsigen libraries are required because
Camlhighlight provides functions that output values from Ocsigen's XHTML.M
module.  Sexplib is used to provide serialisation facilities, and Ulex
is the lexer generator used.

Camlhighlight requires also Highlight, of course.  Use version 2.10 or
higher, since earlier releases do not make a clean separation between
the core library and the command line application.


3. Building and installing
==========================

Edit Camlhighlight's top-level Makefile to configure the location of
Highlight's libhighlight.a, C++ header files, and the style and language
definition files (*.style and *.lang).

Typing "make" suffices to build the Camlhighlight library.  After
building, "make install" will perform a findlib installation.  To
generate the ocamldoc API documentation, use "make apidoc".
